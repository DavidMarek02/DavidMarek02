## Some super important stuff about me!

I am a photographer, sometimes even videographer, if i try hard enough and someone offers me a good price i can be even editor!!
I am also childish but hard working, even tho iam a team player sometimes a like to take my time and work alone.
I am master gamer and competitive music enjoyer.
- Basically when something is beautiful I capture it and make it more beautiful and if something is not that beautiful i try to not mess it up even more!
- I love exploring, traveling and I try to capture the beauty in this world cause I think we can all appreciate it at least a little bit more 
- My music playlists are straight up fire

- We have been asked to make an intro for national beauty contest: Miss Czech Republic
- Our job was to introduce CEO and executive producers of this contest with contestants
- Even tho the job was very important and very challenging i have a feeling of satisfaction that we did the absolute best we could
- Also it was very cool to see our work live on national TV

## What i do in the shadows/ My free time 

### Illustrations
![my ilustrations](https://github.com/MirekCernyIV/english-for-designers1/assets/149397901/c9220056-12cb-4b5d-ba20-a9c797fb01e9)



- When I have some time on my hands, I use it to draw. I love mythology and history, so I am trying to combine these topics together with more modern styles, like the hipster Odin or Circle of life (where the 3 lizards reprezent three differnet religions) 
- These things are just something, that i do to relax my little smooth brain. 
### Student film

- My greatest current project is a student film where I am working on the script, storyboards, animatics, concept art, 3D modeling, rigging, dubbing, animation, and compositing.  So sometimes, it can be a little bit overwhelming.

- Despite each of these categories bringing completely new and different problems, the biggest challenge for me is to forget ideas. It is very common that suddenly, I come up with a new way to tell the story, and out of the blue, I catch myself changing the whole script.

- This project is pretty significant for me because I have the chance to try different fields and learn new skills.
