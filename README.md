## Some super important stuff about me!

I am a photographer, sometimes even videographer, if i try hard enough and someone offers me a good price i can be even editor!!
I am also childish but hard working, even tho iam a team player sometimes a like to take my time and work alone.
I am master gamer and competitive music enjoyer.
- Basically when something is beautiful I capture it and make it more beautiful and if something is not that beautiful i try to not mess it up even more!
- I love exploring, traveling and I try to capture the beauty in this world cause I think we can all appreciate it at least a little bit more 
- My music playlists are straight up fire

- We have been asked to make an intro for national beauty contest: Miss Czech Republic
- Our job was to introduce CEO and executive producers of this contest with contestants
- Even tho the job was very important and very challenging i have a feeling of satisfaction that we did the absolute best we could
- Also it was very cool to see our work live on national TV

- I have always like lego since i was a little kid
- It felt so great when the biggest lego museum in Czech Republic agreed to work together
- My job there is to promote their exponents and manage their social media
- It really cant even feel like job when you just play with lego whole day and gets paid for it!
